# Customer & Sales Analysis - SQL

This project contains three SQL queries for basic customer and sales analysis using the `dvdrental` database.

## Files
- `avg_rental_duration_by_genre.sql`: Calculates the average rental duration by genre.
- `no_rental_last_month.sql`: Lists customers who had no rentals last month.
- `top_10_countries_by_payment.sql`: Shows the top 10 countries by total payment.

## How to Run
- Database required: `dvdrental` (PostgreSQL).
- Open the SQL files in a SQL client (e.g., pgAdmin) and execute the queries.

## Data
- The project uses the `dvdrental` sample database.
- If you don't have the full database, you can create a small sample dataset for testing.
